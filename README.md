# Auto Audio Listener

A simple tool to "listen" to an audio device, similar to Windows "Listen to this device" but with additional features. Implemented with NAudio

## Features it should have

- Direct audio from an input device (line in/mic) to an output device
- Mute audio when input audio is below certain volume to eliminate noise floor while nothing is playing
- Fade in when the input audio becomes alive again
- Decent looking volume meter
- Customizable settings
- Run on startup

Many UI are missing by the time you see this page, so there are very few settings to change.

I made this so I can connect my phone's 3.5mm output to my pc and conveniently listen to it on my pc headset, and have it to mute the audio for me automatically so I don't have to listen to the irritating background noise while everything should be silent.
